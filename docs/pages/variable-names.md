## Variable Names 

Informally, a variable (also called an object) is a place you can store a value. So that you can refer to it unambiguously, a variable needs a name. You can think of the variables in your program as a set of boxes or cubbyholes, each with a label giving its name; you might imagine that storing a value in a variable consists of writing the value on a slip of paper and placing it in the cubbyhole.
