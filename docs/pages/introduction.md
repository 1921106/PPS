Introduction 

C is a general-purpose programming language and is run on all
platforms.  It provides a variety of data types.  The fundamental types
are characters, integers and floating point numbers of several sizes. 
In addition, there may be a variety of derived data types.  Expressions
are formed from operators and operands.

C provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for
well-structured programs.  Functions may return values of basic types,
or derived data types.

Since C is relatively small, it can be described in a small space, and
learned quickly.  A programmer can reasonably expect to know and
understand and indeed regularly use the entire language.

Because the data types and control structures provided by C are
supported directly by most computers, the run-time library required to
implement self-contained programs is tiny.  The standard library
functions are only called explicitly, so they can be avoided if they
are not needed.  Most can be written in C, and except for the operating
system details they conceal, are themselves portable.

Although C matches the capabilities of many computers, it is
independent of any particular machine architecture.  With a little care
it is easy to write portable programs, that is, programs that can be
run without change on a variety of hardware.  The standard makes
portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of constants that
characterise the machine on which the program is run.

C's basic philosophy is that programmers know what they are doing; it
only requires that they state their intentions explicitly.
