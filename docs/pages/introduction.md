Introduction 

C is a general-purpose programming language and is run on all
platforms. It provides a variety of data types. The fundamental types
are characters, integers and floating point numbers of several sizes. 
In addition, there may be a variety of derived data types. Expressions
are formed from operators and operands.

C provides the fundamental control-flow constructions required for
well-structured programs. Functions may return values of basic types,
or derived data types.

Since C is relatively small, it can be described in a small space, and
learned quickly. A programmer can reasonably expect to know and
understand and indeed regularly use the entire language.

Although C matches the capabilities of many computers, it is
independent of any particular machine architecture. With a little care
it is easy to write portable programs, that is, programs that can be
run without change on a variety of hardware. The standard makes
portability issues explicit, and prescribes a set of constants that
characterise the machine on which the program is run.

C's basic philosophy is that programmers know what they are doing; it
only requires that they state their intentions explicitly.
